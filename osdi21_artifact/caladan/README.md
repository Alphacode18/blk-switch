# Caladan Evaluation

**Note:** This README is self-contained. It contains instructions to setup and evaluate against Caladan (one of the baselines used in the paper). You do not need to build/setup blk-switch for this. Just the instructions here are sufficient.

**Note:** Our evaluation in the submitted paper was against a verison the caladan codebase that the authors shared with us before their OSDI'20 artifact was ready. We have included a copy of this codebase inline for reproducibility.

### Build and setup Caladan
Refer to the README file in `caladan-code` for detailed instuctions on how to build and setup Caladan. These need to be run on both Host and Target machines
